      solution: 'Solution: Blkgoldmusic.com is a simple web application that allows users to quickly find my music, videos, and any related information to the project. It shows fans my most recent releases on the home page along with all applicable social media links, and a contact form to stay up to date with the project via email. The responsive web app was built with Sass and Bootstrap for a smooth responsive design, complete with some simple React routing and modals to easily show applicable information.',
      outcome: 'Outcome: The site is a simple responsive React application with a clean and quick UI. Through designing, developing and deploying this modern, yet simple application, my overall followers increased by around 100 users across all social platforms and has given me a way to access fans of my music directly.',

This site needed to be simple and easy for nontechnical people to be able to see our work, what we\'re about and get in contact with us.',
      solution: 'Solution: A simple, straightforward design making it easy for anyone to find us and what we do. The page is straight forward and minimal.',
      outcome: 'Outcome: The site contains minimal design tricks and maximum userability and responsiveness. We employed CircleCi to consistently test the application, and built the site utilizing an agile methodology. The site contains a simple contact form and is deployed with amazon web services.',

      challenge: 'Challenge: The original site was broken and extremely dated, I was approached to help improve their web presence and give the artist a homebase to work from. We needed something that was new, creative, showcased the artists talents, and felt engaging to fans without going overboard. I needed to be able to show images and videos without costing the user too much, and use custom graphics with abnormal placement to achieve the vision the artists and his designer eventually landed on.',
      solution: 'Solution: A complete site redesign from the ground up working closely with the artist and his graphic designer. This is a page achieves the visions they set without being too taxing on the end user. Everything is made with custom icons and fonts, a custom sliding drawer in the bottom for socials and subscribe via email, and gives users what they need in regards to tour dates and the store.',
      outcome: 'Outcome: The website went from being completely stagnant, to having over 10,000 users immediately. I took their vision from from concept to full on web application and deployed the site using Angular, styled with Bootstrap and Sass.',

I needed something that felt modern but was easy to navigate, responsive, fast in terms of load times, and included a blog as I've been interested in building one for some time.`,
      solution: 'Solution: I decided to take on the project with NextJS as it allows me to code some things with React and I was already familiar. Next also comes with the back end somewhat built in, so I knew creating the blog should be fairly straight forward. While I ran into some odd hiccups compared to React (just with how data is handled at times, and learning to use the built in routing system) the end result is this snappy and responsive web app.',
      outcome: `Outcome: You're looking at it! This site is responsive, has some simple functionality and animations, a blog that runs from GraphCMS via GraphQL and is fully responsive for every device with Tailwind and some styled-components.`,
